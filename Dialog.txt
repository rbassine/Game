Persona
More stuff to be implemented
This line is a test line...
I am going to need to make it so that a long line will move the extra text to another line, rather than use the scroll bar...
but the is more text to make sure the scroll pane is working properly
Hopefully it is.
But later this text is going to be replaced with some sample text that will at least be more interesting.
However, for now it is just this.
Never mind about the comment above about making the horizontal scroll bar not needed.
Apparently the JTextArea already does that...
But a few more lines are needed to fill the JTextArea
So
I
am
doing
it
this
way
for
now...
